## 🎯 About Me

I'm a solo developer who thrives on **automation**, **AI tools**, and **high-performance systems**. I believe in:

- **Building fast** → CLI-first, API-always philosophy
- **Keeping it clean** → No bloat, no unnecessary complexity
- **Maximum control** → Minimal interfaces, maximum functionality
- **Shipping quality** → Every line of code serves a purpose

I don't chase trends—I chase problems. Whether it's orchestrating distributed systems, crafting intelligent bots, or automating the tedious, I'm here to build solutions that actually work.

## 🧠 What I Build

### 🤖 Automation Engines
Making the complex simple. Scripts and systems that run your world. From task orchestration to intelligent workflow management.

### 🎵 AI-Powered Bots
Music discovery, moderation, content delivery. Smart bots powered by cutting-edge APIs and real-time processing.

### 🔐 Secure Systems
Protection that scales. Always-on monitoring, abuse prevention, and data integrity with streamlined, efficient code.

### ⚙️ Minimal UIs, Maximal Control
Interfaces that do more by doing less. CLI tools and APIs that give you complete control over your systems.
